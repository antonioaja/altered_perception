# altered_perception

A rust library for converting and using various color spaces. It currently supports both HSV, HSL, and Luma pixels with conversion to and from RGB pixels.

This library is done in the vain of the rgb crate: https://github.com/kornelski/rust-rgb

# Changes

Various changes will be made since this is my first library. All methods/structs will stabilize by v1.0.0 release as I am still deciding on the structure of this crate.

This should stabilize by April 2023.

# Additional Color Spaces

Support for more color spaces will be added as time goes on. Contributions are welcome.
